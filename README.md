Raycasting in JavaScript, based upon Maksim Ivanov's youtube tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nSFArCgCXA

Maksim Ivanov's YT tutorial, but:
1. minimap on separate canvas, contains full fov drawing
2. rotation by keyboard (ArrowLeft/ArrowRight keys) not mouse, rotational speed capped by rotations per second
3. textures rendered on walls in scene, slight shading to differentiate H and V walls, wall shading at distances 8-45 cells away
4. running (SHIFT key)
5. strafing left/right (Q, W keys respectively)
6. collision prevention vs walls
